1.1 Systems architecture

- the purpose of the CPU
- Von Neumann architecture
= MAR (Memory Address Register)
= MDR (Memory Data Register)
= Program Counter
= Accumulator
- common CPU components and their function
= ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
= CU (Control Unit)
= Cache
- the function of the CPU as fetch and execute instructions stored in memory
- how common characteristics of CPUs affect their performance
= clock speed
= cache size
= number of cores
- embedded systems
= purpose of embedded systems
= examples of embedded sytems.

1.2 Memory

- the difference between RAM and ROM
- the purpose of ROM in a computer system
- the purpose of RAM in a computer system
- the need for virtual memory
- flash memory.

1.3 Storage

- the need for secondary storage
- data capacity and calculation of data capacity requirements
- common types of storage
= optical

= solid state
- suitable storage devices and storage media for a given application, and the advantages and
disadvantages of these, using characteristics
= capacity
= speed
= portability
= durability
= reliability
= cost.

1.4 Wired and wireless networks

- types of networks
= LAN (Local Area Network)
= WAN (Wide Area Network)
- factors that affect the performance of networks
- the different roles of computers in a client-server and a peer-to-peer network
- the hardware needed to connect stand-alone computers into a Local Area Network
= wireless access points
= routers/switches
= NIC (Network Interface Controller/Card)
= transmission media
- the internet as a worldwide collection of computer networks
= DNS (Domain Name Server)
= hosting
= the cloud
- the concept of virtual networks.

1.5 Network topologies, protocols and layers

= TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
= HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
= HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)
= FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
= POP (Post Office Protocol)
= IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
= SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- the concept of layers
- packet switching.

1.6 System security

- forms of attack
- threats posed to networks
= malware
= phishing
= people as the ‘weak point’ in secure systems (social engineering)
= brute force attacks
= denial of service attacks
= data interception and theft
= the concept of SQL injection
= poor network policy
- identifying and preventing vulnerabilities
= penetration testing
= network forensics
= network policies
= anti-malware software
= firewalls
= user access levels
= passwords
= encryption.

1.7 The purpose and functionality of systems software
- operating systems
= user interface
= memory management/multitasking
= peripheral management and drivers
= user management
= file management
- utility system software
= encryption software
= defragmentation
= data compression
= the role and methods of backup

1.8 Ethical, legal, cultural and environmental concerns
